I work as a senior software engineer at Google. I graduated a double degree
program in computer science and mathematics at the University of Warsaw with a
master's degree in CS and a bachelor's degree in mathematics. Both, CS and
mathematics, are my passions.

When I am not working, I like to hike, run, read, program, or just enjoy time
with friends.
