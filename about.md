I work as a software engineer at Google. I graduated a Double Degree Program in
Computer Science and Mathematics at University of Warsaw with master's degree in
CS and bachelor's in mathematics. Both, CS and mathematics, are my passions.

When I am not working, I like to hike, run, read, program, or just enjoy time
with friends.
