title:  "Supercard's IDOR Vulnerability"

Last March I've discovered and reported a vulnerability in Coop, a Swiss major
grocery stores chain. I found out that that stores' receipts are publicly
visible. Anyone in Switzerland that knows a receipt's barcode can see that
receipt. The receipts are also guessable as they do not contain any random
information, so it's possible to search for valid barcode and get arbitrary
receipts, e.g., all receipts from a given shop.
